# Hubspot
## Introduction
HubSpot is a platform that connects your marketing, sales, and services tools to a unified **CRM** database. 
In this framework, the feature of the Hubspot is integrated for users to better manage the relationship between customers.

## Setup
Setting up the private app
* Login to [Hubspot](https://app.hubspot.com/login) and then go to âš™ (Settings icon) on the top right
* On the left navbar, go to **Integrations** > **Private Apps**
* Create a new private app 
* Give a name for the new private app ("agent-integration"), upload a logo, and give some descriptions if you want
* Go to scopes to add the following necessary scopes:
  * crm.lists.read
  * crm.lists.write
  * crm.objects.contacts.read
  * crm.objects.contacts.write
  * crm.schemas.contacts.read
  * tickets
* The process of creating new private app is finished. The access token could be obtained.
* Adding relevant data for your company using several ways, such as **Import from files**, **Sync from files** and **Migrate from your data.**

## Implementation
### find_contact_by_email(email, chat, **kwargs): 
This function aims to find the existing customer by their emails and update the last activity date. 

Inputs:
* `email`: the email address of the customer (It should be noted that email address is also a unique identifier for each customer)
* `chat`: the chat content that customer communicates with the chatbot
* `**kwargs`: contains the **access token** for the hubspot private app

Output:
* `contact_info_properties`: id, email, first_name and last_name of the contact of the existing customer

There are several steps for the implementation of this function:
* Detect whether the customer is the existing one using `email`:
  
  ```python
  public_object_search_request = PublicObjectSearchRequest(
        filter_groups=[
            {
                "filters": [
                    {
                        "propertyName": "email",
                        "operator": "EQ",
                        "value": email
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    )

  try:
    contact_search_response = api_client.crm.contacts.search_api.do_search(public_object_search_request=public_object_search_request)
    logger.info("Found contact by email: {}".format(email))
    contact_search_response = contact_search_response.to_dict()
  ```

* If the user is not an existing customer, `USER_NOT_FOUND_ERROR` will be returned. If the user is the existing customer, the response of search_api is shown below. 
The structure of a contact is demonstrated inside the `results` field.
  ```
  {'paging': None,
   'results': [{'archived': False,
                'archived_at': None,
                'created_at': datetime.datetime(2025, 2, 15, 21, 23, 10, 453000, tzinfo=tzutc()),
                'id': '84246479604',
                'properties': {'createdate': '2025-02-15T21:23:10.453Z',
                               'email': 'sarah@gmail.com',
                               'firstname': 'Sarah',
                               'hs_object_id': '84246479604',
                               'lastmodifieddate': '2025-02-23T22:15:05.802Z',
                               'lastname': 'Mark'},
                'properties_with_history': None,
                'updated_at': datetime.datetime(2025, 2, 23, 22, 15, 5, 802000, tzinfo=tzutc())}],
   'total': 1}
  ```
  
  In Hubspot the detailed information of the **contact** is looked like below:
  
  ![hubspot_contact.png](../../static/img/hubspot/hubspot_contact.png)

* Then a **communication** object will be created, whose content is `chat`:
  
  ```python
  if contact_search_response['total'] == 1:
    contact_id = contact_search_response['results'][0]['id']
    communication_data = SimplePublicObjectInputForCreate(
        properties = {
            "hs_communication_channel_type": "CUSTOM_CHANNEL_CONVERSATION",
            "hs_communication_body": chat,
            "hs_communication_logged_from": "CRM",
            "hs_timestamp": datetime.now(timezone.utc).isoformat(),
            }
    )
    contact_info_properties = {
        'id': contact_id,
        'email': email,
        'first_name': contact_search_response['results'][0]['properties'].get('firstname'),
        'last_name': contact_search_response['results'][0]['properties'].get('lastname')
    }
    try:
        communication_creation_response = api_client.crm.objects.communications.basic_api.create(communication_data)
        communication_creation_response = communication_creation_response.to_dict()
  ```
  
  The structure of the **communication** object is shown below:
  ```
   {'archived': False,
   'archived_at': None,
   'created_at': datetime.datetime(2025, 2, 25, 0, 26, 48, 751000, tzinfo=tzutc()),
   'id': '81116227304',
   'properties': {'hs_body_preview': 'I want to know more about your product: '
                                     'Adam',
                  'hs_body_preview_html': '<html>\n'
                                          ' <head></head>\n'
                                          ' <body>\n'
                                          ' I want to know more about your '
                                          'product: Adam\n'
                                          ' </body>\n'
                                          '</html>',
                  'hs_body_preview_is_truncated': 'false',
                  'hs_communication_body': 'I want to know more about your '
                                           'product: Adam',
                  'hs_communication_channel_type': 'CUSTOM_CHANNEL_CONVERSATION',
                  'hs_communication_logged_from': 'CRM',
                  'hs_createdate': '2025-02-25T00:26:48.751Z',
                  'hs_lastmodifieddate': '2025-02-25T00:26:48.751Z',
                  'hs_object_id': '81116227304',
                  'hs_object_source': 'INTEGRATION',
                  'hs_object_source_id': '8190657',
                  'hs_object_source_label': 'INTEGRATION',
                  'hs_timestamp': '2025-02-25T00:26:48.370Z'},
   'properties_with_history': None,
   'updated_at': datetime.datetime(2025, 2, 25, 0, 26, 48, 751000, tzinfo=tzutc())}
  ```
  
  On Hubspot you could see a **communication** object is correspondingly created:
  
  ![hubspot_communication.png](../../static/img/hubspot/hubspot_communication.png)

* Associate the **created communication** with the **contact**. 
After associating, the `'lastmodifieddate'` and `'updated_at'` of contact will be updated accordingly.:
  
  ```python
  communication_id = communication_creation_response['id']
  association_spec = [
    AssociationSpec(
        association_category="HUBSPOT_DEFINED",
        association_type_id=82
    )
  ]
  try:
    association_creation_response = api_client.crm.associations.v4.basic_api.create(
        object_type="contact",
        object_id=contact_id,
        to_object_type="communication",
        to_object_id=communication_id,
        association_spec=association_spec
    )
  ```
  
  The structure of the association object is shown below:
  ```
  {'from_object_id': '84246479604',
   'from_object_type_id': '0-1',
   'labels': [],
   'to_object_id': '81116227304',
   'to_object_type_id': '0-18'}
  ```
  At the same time, `Last Activity Date` on the **contact** information page is also updated as well:
  
  ![hubspot_updated_date.png](../../static/img/hubspot/hubspot_updated_date.png)
  
  
### create_ticket(contact_information, issue, **kwargs): 
When users need technical support/repair service/exchange service, the function will be called. This function is used to create the ticket only for existing customers after calling `find_contact_by_email` function.

Inputs:
* `contact_information`: `id`, `email`, `first_name` and `last_name` of the contact of the existing customer returned from `find_contact_by_email`
* `issue`: the issue that the customer has for the product
* `**kwargs`: contains the **access token** for the hubspot private app

Output:
* `ticket_information`: The basic ticket information for the existing customer and the specific issue (ticket_id)

There are several steps for the implementation of this function:
* Create a **ticket** for the existing customer:
  
  ```python
  timestamp = datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ")[:-3] + "Z"
  subject_name = "Issue of " + contact_id + " at " + timestamp
  ticket_properties = {
        'hs_pipeline_stage': 1,
        'content': issue,
        'subject': subject_name
    }
  ticket_for_create = SimplePublicObjectInputForCreate(properties=ticket_properties)
  try:
    ticket_creation_response = api_client.crm.tickets.basic_api.create(simple_public_object_input_for_create=ticket_for_create)
    ticket_creation_response = ticket_creation_response.to_dict()
  ```

  The structure of the created **ticket** is like:
  ```
  {'archived': False,
   'archived_at': None,
   'created_at': datetime.datetime(2025, 2, 25, 0, 35, 5, 747000, tzinfo=tzutc()),
   'id': '33397362407',
   'properties': {'content': 'Issue in installing the DUST-E robot',
                  'createdate': '2025-02-25T00:35:05.747Z',
                  'hs_helpdesk_sort_timestamp': '2025-02-25T00:35:05.747Z',
                  'hs_is_visible_in_help_desk': 'true',
                  'hs_last_message_from_visitor': 'false',
                  'hs_lastmodifieddate': '2025-02-25T00:35:05.747Z',
                  'hs_num_associated_companies': '0',
                  'hs_num_associated_conversations': '0',
                  'hs_num_times_contacted': '0',
                  'hs_object_id': '33397362407',
                  'hs_object_source': 'INTEGRATION',
                  'hs_object_source_id': '8190657',
                  'hs_object_source_label': 'INTEGRATION',
                  'hs_pipeline': '0',
                  'hs_pipeline_stage': '1',
                  'hs_ticket_id': '33397362407',
                  'num_notes': '0',
                  'subject': 'Issue of 84246479604 at 2025-02-24T19:35:05.4180Z'},
   'properties_with_history': None,
   'updated_at': datetime.datetime(2025, 2, 25, 0, 35, 5, 747000, tzinfo=tzutc())}
  ```
  
  On Hubspot, you could see the detailed information of a **ticket**:

  ![hubspot_ticket.png](../../static/img/hubspot/hubspot_ticket.png)


* Associate the created **ticket** with the **contact**. It should be noted that `'lastmodifieddate'` and `'updated_at'` of contact will be updated after logging a ticket
  (On Hubspot, `Last Activity Date` of the **contact** is also updated:
  
  ```python
  ticket_id = ticket_creation_response['id']
  association_spec = [
    AssociationSpec(
        association_category="HUBSPOT_DEFINED",
        association_type_id=15
        )
  ]
  ticket_information = {
    'id': ticket_id
  }
  try:
    association_creation_response = api_client.crm.associations.v4.basic_api.create(
        object_type="contact",
        object_id=contact_id,
        to_object_type="ticket",
        to_object_id=ticket_id,
        association_spec=association_spec
    )
  ```

## Taskgraph
**Fields**:
* `nodes`: The nodes in the TaskGraph, each node contains the worker/tool name, task, and the directed attribute.
* `edges`: The edges in the TaskGraph, each edge contains the intent, weight, pred, definition, and sample_utterances.
The edge defines the connection between two nodes
* Fields in the config file: role, user_objective, builder_objective, domain, intro, task_docs, rag_docs, tasks, workers, tools
* `nluapi`: It will automatically add the default NLU api which use the `NLUOpenAIAPI` service defined under `./arklex/orchestrator/NLU/api.py` file. If you want to customize the NLU api, you can change the `nluapi` field to your own NLU api url.
* `slotfillapi`: It will automatically add the default SlotFill api which use the `SlotFillOpenAIAPI` service defined under `./arklex/orchestrator/NLU/api.py` file. If you want to customize the SlotFill api, you can change the `slotfillapi` field to your own SlotFill api url.

In the **Hubspot Integration**, there are two intents for users communicating the chatbot:
* When users have **questions** about the product, the chatbot will firstly ask for users' email to detect 
whether they are existing customers. At the same time, it will update the contact's last activity date if the user is an existing customer.
Then it will use `FaissRAGWorker` to generate answer for user's question. So the basic flow for this case is: `start_node -> search_customer -> FaissRAGWorker`
* When users need **technical support/repair service/exchange service** about the product, the chatbot will firstly ask for users' email to detect 
whether they are existing customers. At the same time, it will update the contact's last activity date if the user is an existing customer.
Then it will move to create a ticket for the corresponding issue and head it to the technician support team. 
So the basic flow for this case is: `start_node -> search_customer -> create_ticket`

So the taskgraph to handle these two cases is shown below:
```json

## Running the chatbot
When the taskgraph is generated, you could use the following command to run the chatbot (suppose the `./examples/hubspot` contains the taskgraph):
`python run.py --input-dir ./examples/hubspot`

## Sample conversation
(1) 1st case (When user has questions about the product)
```
