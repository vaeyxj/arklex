# RAGWorker
## Introduction

RAGWorkers are also one of the main building blocks and supports the bot in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to retrieve the relevant information and compose a response based on that.

# Implementation

RAGWorker provides one of the critical fuction for nearly all bots.

This workers consists of 3 nodes: a start node, a retriever node, a tool generator node connected together in a piepline. Given a question, the retriever node retrieves the relevant information through applying FAISS on the RAG documents listed in the configs, then it pipes to the tool generator node which uses it to construct an answer to the given question.

### Class Attributes
`description`: *"Answer the user's questions based on the company's internal documentations (unstructured text data), such as the policies, FAQs, and product information"*\
`llm`: LLM model to be used for path generation\
`action_graph`: LangGraph StateGraph

#### Visualization
```mermaid
graph LR;
    start["START"]--"retrieve()"-->retriever["retriever"]--"context_generate()"-->tool_generator["tool_generator"];
```
## Instantiation
On instantiation, the LLM model and the StateGraph is created with the nodes and edges declaration.

```py
def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.action_graph = self._create_action_graph()
        self.llm = ChatOpenAI(model=MODEL["model_type_or_path"], timeout=30000)
     
def _create_action_graph(self):
    workflow = StateGraph(MessageState)
    # Add nodes for each worker
    workflow.add_node("retriever", RetrieveEngine.retrieve)
    workflow.add_node("tool_generator", ToolGenerator.context_generate)
    # Add edges
    workflow.add_edge(START, "retriever")
    workflow.add_edge("retriever", "tool_generator")
    return workflow
```

## Execution
### Retrieval 

For the R of RAG, the `retriever` node calls the `RetrieveEngine.retrieve` method which loads the relevant chunked documents from the path set in `DATA_DIR` environment variable through the LangChain's FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) package. This ensures that only the relevant information are retrieved to compose the response.

### Generation
For the G of RAG, the `tool_generator` node calls the `ToolGenerator.context_generate` method which generates a response given the retrieved information. Very similar to the text generator component for [MessageWorker](./MessageWorker.mdx), the main difference is the inclusion of the context in the prompt and its invoke call.
